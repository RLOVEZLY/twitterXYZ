"Thanks for reading this #twitterfiction story!"
"Operation Marty Gee complete. \n#twitterfiction"
"\"Ain't that the truth,\" Suzi said, admiring her emerald ring, as Gabby handed her a check for two hundred fifty thousand dollars."
"\"We both did,\" Gabby responded, adding a succinct \"There's no fool like an old fool with a hard on.\"  #twitterfiction"
"\"You did well,\" Suzi cooed."
"The two women clinked champagne glasses."
"The moment they'd met at the nail salon, Suzi had known Gabby was the one!"
"A week later Gabby and Suzi had a celebratory lunch in a penthouse apartment Marty knew nothing about."
"Suzi Gee received a large emerald ring she'd been coveting."
"Marty Gee had his lawyers settle with Gabby to drop all charges. For five hundred thousand dollars she did so."
"The police turned up at his apartment. Marty was outraged. So was his wife, Suzi."
"Several hours later Gabby filed a complaint against Marty Gee for sexual harassment.  #twitterfiction"
"\"Bitch!\" he yelled after her."
"She jumped to her feet. Marty grabbed her breasts. Gabby kicked him and ran."
"This was too much, even for Gabby who knew a thing or two about men."
"He stood up, walked around his desk and shoved his erection in her face, startling her."
"Gabby wanted to talk about her career before bestowing sexual favors. Marty didn't."
"Marty licked his lips in anticipation.  #twitterfiction"
"Gabby sat on a chair in front of his desk. She crossed her legs in a provocative fashion, feeling like Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct."
"\u2026 especially when he had a pretty girl in his sights."
"Marty's office was large, his desk dominated. The desk of a man in control.  Ah yes, Marty always enjoyed being in control\u2026"
"Across the room, Suzi observed the exchange."
"And so it was on. Marty slipped her his card and told her to meet him at his office in an hour. Gabby assured him she'd be there."
"\"Of course,\" she said, widening her blue eyes.  #twitterfiction"
"Smile on his face, lecherous eyes on her boobs, Gabby threw a few more compliments in his direction. \"You an actress?\" he asked"
"Never adverse to a compliment or a pretty girl, Marty beamed."
"\"Hey,\" Gabby said, sidling up to Marty, all tits on show and glossy over enhanced lips. \"I think you're a genius!\""
"Besides, she had an ironclad pre-nup. Financial security ruled."
"Suzi Gee, was no fool. She knew exactly what her husband's game was, and as long as he didn't embarrass her, she was cool."
"She had him in her sights and that was that.  Too bad he had a wife, Suzi Gee."
"Gabby edged closer to her prey.  He was jowly and balding and heading fast toward seventy.  Gabby didn't care.  #twitterfiction"
"Gabby was ready to see if the rumors were true."
"Marty's reputation was that in exchange for a blowjob he would give any obliging girl a small role in one of his movies."
"Marty, although married, had a lethal reputation."
"Gabby Reed\u2014an ambitious young actress/model\u2014stared across a crowded party at Marty Gee, an uber-successful movie producer."
