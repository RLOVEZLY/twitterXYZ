"@thomasfuchs @kvz But you could never drive a company if any issue an individual has stops the production line. Systems thinking."
"@thomasfuchs @kvz At Apple's scale, there are thousands of people at the 99.999th percentile."
"@thomasfuchs @kvz The way to understand it is to realize that you're not the majority case. I personally haven't had any issues with it."
"@thomasfuchs Generally not. We prioritize bug work alongside other work. Many bugs are important enough to get high billing. Many are not."
"@kvz @thomasfuchs I remember reading reports from 2006 about how the end was near with Apple software quality. Same in 2001 after OSX."

"@tpamatt @thomasfuchs It's exactly the aim for the excellence that requires you don't get stuck in the weeds chasing bugs as unicorns."
"@thomasfuchs More bugs fixed = more resilient software is not something I'd argue against. But placing resilience on a pedestal is."
"@thomasfuchs That's the easy out. The harder one is when those two are in opposition for limited time and attention. Which is always so."
"@thomasfuchs There's no separate prize for having the most bug free software. Only the most useful."
"@thomasfuchs Fixing edge-casy or inconsequential bugs over adding new features is often a poor priority of time."
"@thomasfuchs And that return is utterly utilitarian: Whatever grants most benefit to most people should generally take priority."
"@thomasfuchs I don't believe in broken windows theory for bugs. It's a local maxima. Return on developer time spent is what matters."
